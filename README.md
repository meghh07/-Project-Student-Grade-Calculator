A simple Python program that calculates a student's grade based on marks and displays encouraging messages.
This project was developed as part of an internship task to practice Python basics including conditional statements, loops, functions, and input validation.

📌 Project Features
Takes student name as input
Accepts marks between 0–100
Uses if-elif-else for grading logic
Validates input using a while loop
Handles invalid inputs using try-except
Displays encouraging messages for each grade
Uses a custom function for grade calculation

📝 Grading Logic
Marks Range	Grade
90 – 100	A
80 – 89	    B
70 – 79	    C
60 – 69	    D
0  – 59	    F   

💻 Sample Output
Enter student name: Priya
Enter marks (0-100): 85

📊 RESULT FOR PRIYA:
Marks: 85 /100
Grade: B
Message: Very Good! Keep it up! 👍
